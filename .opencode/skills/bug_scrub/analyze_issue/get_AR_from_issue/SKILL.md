## Base Path Reference

Relative paths from this file location (`bug_scrub/analyze_issue/get_AR_from_issue/`):
```
../../..                     → issue_triage root
../../../ci_results/         → CI artifacts directory
../../../result/             → Excel results directory
```

## Overview
This skill extracts Action Required (AR) information from GitHub issues by analyzing:
1. Related PRs that fix the issue
2. Issue comment threads for unresolved requests

Uses deep investigation rather than surface pattern matching.

## When to Use
- Extract PR information linked to an issue
- Analyze PR status and action required
- Identify unresolved requests from issue comments
- Determine ownership for action items

## Preconditions

### Required Access
- GitHub CLI authenticated session (recommended)
- WebFetch capability as fallback

### Source Paths (relative from bug_scrub/)
```
Issue data: GitHub API or WebFetch
PR data: GitHub API or WebFetch  
Comment history: GitHub API or WebFetch
CI results: ../../../ci_results/
Excel file: ../../../result/torch_xpu_ops_issues.xlsx
```

## Tools

### 1. Bash (gh CLI)

Primary tool for GitHub API access:

```bash
# Find related PRs via timeline
gh api repos/intel/torch-xpu-ops/issues/{issue_number}/timeline --paginate --jq \
  '.items[] | select(.event == "cross-referenced") | .source.issue | {number: .number, title: .title}'

# Fetch PR details
gh pr view {pr_number} --repo intel/torch-xpu-ops --json number,title,body,state,author

# Fetch PR reviews  
gh api repos/intel/torch-xpu-ops/pulls/{pr_number}/reviews --jq '.[] | {user: .user.login, state: .state}'

# Fetch issue comments
gh api repos/intel/torch-xpu-ops/issues/{issue_number}/comments --jq '.[] | {user: .user.login, body: .body}'

# Fetch PR check runs
gh api repos/intel/torch-xpu-ops/pulls/{pr_number}/check-runs --jq '.check_runs[] | {name: .name, conclusion: .conclusion}'
```

### 2. WebFetch

Fallback when gh CLI unavailable:
- `{PR_url}` - Main PR page
- `{PR_url}/checks` - CI status
- `{issue_url}` - Main issue page with comments

### 3. Explore Agent (Deep Analysis)

Use for deep investigation of PR and code:

```python
task(description="pr_issue_deep_relationship",
     prompt=f"""
INVESTIGATION: PR #{{pr_number}} - Issue #{{issue_number}} Relationship

Deep analysis of:
1. PR title and body - verify issue linkage
2. Code changes - understand fix scope
3. Files modified - assess implementation
4. PR status - get check_pr_status gates
5. Issue comments - extract unresolved requests

REQUIRED VECTOR:
- Always verify findings with actual data
- Cross-reference PR body with issue reference patterns
- Use explore to deep-dive issue requirements

## Part 1: AR from Related PR

### Step 1: Find Related PR from Issue

PR discovery uses **multiple complementary vectors** because no single
vector catches every fix PR. In particular, Copilot- or bot-authored PRs
frequently solve an issue without ever referencing the issue number, so
the timeline alone misses them.

#### Excluded sources — do NOT extract PR numbers from these

The following content is environment metadata, not fix references.
Strip these before any text scan:

- `### Versions` section of GitHub bug-report templates (and any
  `Versions:` / `## Versions` heading variant). Contents typically
  include: framework repo URLs, commit SHAs, dependency versions,
  driver versions, OS info — none of these are fix PRs even when they
  resemble PR-style numbers.
- Stack-trace lines, log excerpts inside fenced code blocks, and `pip`
  / `conda` `freeze`-style output.
- Anything inside `<!-- ... -->` HTML comments.

A PR number that appears **only** inside an excluded section is not a
candidate; the fact that it appears elsewhere in the body is required
to elevate it.

#### Vector 0: GitHub linked PRs (highest authority — auto-verifies)

GitHub's "Development" sidebar (and the Copilot agent UI) records
explicit issue↔PR links that do **not** require any "Fixes #N" text in
the PR body. These links are GitHub-managed metadata and represent the
strongest possible intent signal — a PR returned by this vector is
auto-VERIFIED in Step 2 with `verdict_source: "github_linked"`.

This data is available **only via GraphQL**; REST and `gh issue view`
do not surface it. Always query both directions for completeness.

```bash
# From the issue side: PRs that GitHub will close on merge
gh api graphql -f query='{
  repository(owner:"intel", name:"torch-xpu-ops") {
    issue(number: {issue_number}) {
      closedByPullRequestsReferences(first: 20, includeClosedPrs: true) {
        nodes {
          number title state author { login }
          repository { nameWithOwner }
          createdAt mergedAt
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

For each candidate from any subsequent vector (A–D below), it is also
worth checking the reverse direction to confirm the same link exists:

```bash
# From the PR side: issues this PR will close on merge
gh api graphql -f query='{
  repository(owner:"<repo_owner>", name:"<repo_name>") {
    pullRequest(number: {pr_number}) {
      closingIssuesReferences(first: 10) {
        nodes { number title repository { nameWithOwner } }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

A PR appearing on either list is treated as VERIFIED in Step 2 even
when its body has no `#<issue>` text and its files don't overlap.

#### Vector A: Timeline cross-references

```bash
gh api repos/intel/torch-xpu-ops/issues/{issue_number}/timeline --paginate --jq \
  '.[] | select(.event == "cross-referenced") |
   {number: .source.issue.number,
    title:  .source.issue.title,
    state:  .source.issue.state,
    pull_request: (.source.issue.pull_request != null),
    repo_url: .source.issue.repository_url,
    url:    .source.issue.html_url}'
```

This catches PRs whose body or commit message says `#<issue>` /
`Fixes #<issue>` / `intel/torch-xpu-ops#<issue>`.

#### Vector B: Issue body explicit references (after excluded-source strip)

After stripping excluded sources, scan the remaining issue body for:
- `#<digits>` mentions
- Full PR URLs: `https?://github.com/[^/]+/[^/]+/pull/\d+`
- Cross-repo refs: `<owner>/<repo>#\d+`

Each surviving number/URL is a candidate. Note the surrounding text so
the verification step can judge intent (e.g., "ToDo: PR #N" is a
strong fix signal; "broken since PR #N" is a regression source, not
the fix).

#### Vector C: Title-keyword search via `gh pr list`

Required when Vectors A and B return zero candidates, **and**
recommended as a sanity check even when they do return candidates
(catches Copilot-authored PRs).

1. Extract distinctive technical keywords from the issue title:
   prefer multi-word phrases, error names, build flags, op names,
   file fragments. Discard generic tokens like `[Bug]`, `bug`, `XPU`,
   `error`, `failed`.
2. Run `gh pr list` over both states with each keyword phrase:

   ```bash
   gh pr list --repo intel/torch-xpu-ops --state all \
              --search "<keyword phrase>" \
              --json number,title,state,author,createdAt
   ```

3. Bound the search by issue creation date — only PRs created within a
   reasonable window around the issue (typically issue creation date
   ± 90 days) are plausible fixes.

#### Vector E: Fix-Approach text scan (post-Phase-3, when present)

After Phase 3.3 (`triage_skills`) has populated the `Fix Approach` column,
scan that text for PR references using the same patterns as Vector B —
`#<digits>`, full PR URLs, and `<owner>/<repo>#<digits>`. The Fix Approach
is LLM-generated and frequently names a concrete PR ("Land
intel/torch-xpu-ops PR #N: ..."), but because it is written *after* the
issue body it is missed by Vectors A–B which scan only the original issue.

Apply the same excluded-source rules as Vector B (strip code blocks and
HTML comments before scanning). Each surviving number/URL is a candidate
that must still pass Step 2 verification — Fix Approach text is
LLM-generated and CANNOT be trusted as a fix signal on its own.

Vector E is the safety net for two real failure modes:
1. The issue body never named the fix PR (PR was opened later).
2. PR discovery via Vectors A–D returned candidates that all REJECTED
   in Step 2, so Part 1 was about to emit "no verified PR".

When Vector E produces a VERIFIED candidate, it overrides the
"no verified PR" path. When it produces nothing, downstream behaviour
is unchanged.

#### Vector D: File-path search (when issue cites specific files)

If the issue body or stack trace identifies specific source files
(e.g., `src/BuildOnWindows.cmake`, `src/ATen/native/xpu/sycl/Atomics.h`):

```bash
gh pr list --repo intel/torch-xpu-ops --state all \
           --search "<filename>" \
           --json number,title,state
```

Then for each candidate, inspect changed files:

```bash
gh pr view <pr_number> --repo intel/torch-xpu-ops --json files \
  --jq '.files[].path'
```

A PR that touches the same file(s) named in the issue is a strong
candidate even without an issue-number reference.

#### Aggregation

Run Vector 0 first; if it returns any candidate, that candidate is
already auto-VERIFIED and Vectors A–E become a sanity check rather
than the primary discovery path. Always run Vectors A–E anyway to
catch additional related PRs (e.g., follow-up fixes, replacement PRs
opened after a prior PR was closed unmerged). Union all candidates
from Vectors 0 + A–E, dedupe by `(repo, pr_number)`, and pass each
through Step 2 verification. Inner-source / private repo PRs (e.g.,
`intel-innersource/...`) cannot be verified through the public API —
flag them as `unverifiable_private` in the output and treat them as
informational only.

**Replacement-PR rule**: if Vector A surfaces a CLOSED-unmerged PR
and Vectors C / D / E surface a later OPEN or MERGED PR touching the
same files or symptoms, the later PR supersedes the closed one for
verdict purposes. Both are recorded in `pr_analysis`, but the live
verdict is taken from the latest non-rejected one. This prevents the
report from parking on a stale dead PR after a replacement lands.

### Step 2: PR Verification (content-match aware)

**MANDATORY**: every candidate from Step 1 must be verified before
being treated as a fix PR. Verification produces one of three verdicts
per candidate: **VERIFIED**, **REJECTED**, or **UNVERIFIABLE_PRIVATE**.

A candidate is **VERIFIED** if any of the following holds (in priority
order):

0. **GitHub-linked** (Vector 0): the PR appears in the issue's
   `closedByPullRequestsReferences` list, or the issue appears in the
   PR's `closingIssuesReferences` list. This is GitHub-managed
   metadata and auto-verifies regardless of body text or file overlap.
   Record `verdict_source: "github_linked"`.

1. **Explicit reference**: PR body or commit message contains a clean
   reference to the issue (`#<N>`, `Fixes #<N>`, `Closes #<N>`,
   `<owner>/<repo>#<N>`, or full issue URL). The reference must NOT
   appear only inside an excluded section (per Step 1) of the PR body.
   Record `verdict_source: "explicit_reference"`.

2. **Content match (no explicit reference required)**: an explore-agent
   review of the PR concludes that the PR addresses the same problem
   the issue describes. Required evidence:
   - **Same surface**: PR-modified files overlap with files named in
     the issue body or stack trace, OR PR-modified files are the
     ones implicated by the issue's error path.
   - **Same symptom**: PR title/body describes the same error /
     behaviour / build flag / op / dtype as the issue.
   - **Plausible timing**: PR created on or after the issue (or in a
     plausible window before, if the PR predates the issue and the
     issue is a "regression caused by …" report).

   The agent must explicitly justify the match in
   `verification_details.match_reasoning`. Loose topical similarity is
   **not** sufficient — require concrete file or symptom overlap.
   Record `verdict_source: "content_match"`.

A candidate is **REJECTED** if:
- It fails both criteria above.
- The PR's body explicitly references a different issue and is scoped
  there.
- Title/files are clearly unrelated to the issue's domain.

A candidate is **UNVERIFIABLE_PRIVATE** if it lives in a private /
inner-source repo accessible only to the issue's owners — record it
as evidence requiring human follow-up, do not treat as a verified fix.

```bash
# Fetch full PR data for verification
gh pr view {pr_number} --repo {repo} \
  --json number,title,body,state,author,createdAt,mergedAt,files,commits

# For content-match, inspect changed files
gh pr view {pr_number} --repo {repo} --json files --jq '.files[].path'
```

**Verification output schema** (per candidate):

```json
{
  "pr_number": <int>,
  "repo": "<owner/name>",
  "verdict": "VERIFIED" | "REJECTED" | "UNVERIFIABLE_PRIVATE",
  "verification_details": {
    "explicit_reference": true | false,
    "reference_excerpt": "<quoted snippet, if any>",
    "content_match": true | false,
    "match_reasoning": "<agent's justification: which files / symptoms overlap>",
    "files_overlap": [ "<path>", ... ]
  }
}
```

If **all** candidates are REJECTED or UNVERIFIABLE_PRIVATE, Part 1
yields no fix PR and downstream AR comes from Part 2 (comments) only.

### Step 2.5: Live PR-State Re-Check (mandatory before emitting verdict)

`pr_analysis.state` recorded at Phase-4b run time is a **point-in-time
snapshot**. By the time Phase 5 renders `bug_scrub.md` (often hours or
days later), a PR's state may have changed:

- A CLOSED-unmerged PR may have been re-opened.
- An OPEN PR may have been merged (most common case).
- A new replacement PR may have superseded a CLOSED one.

A skill that emits "PR #N closed unmerged; reassess fix path" based on
a stale snapshot will mislead the triager. To prevent this, every
verified PR must be re-queried for its current state immediately
before the verdict verb is emitted (in the Phase 4b agent itself, and
in the Phase 5 reconciliation script):

```bash
gh pr view <pr_number> --repo <owner/name> \
  --json state,mergedAt,closedAt,updatedAt
```

Then apply the **state-precedence rule**:

| Live state | Snapshot state | Resulting verdict |
|---|---|---|
| MERGED | any | VERIFY_AND_CLOSE — "Verify fix from merged PR <ref> and close" |
| OPEN | any | LAND_PR — "Land PR <ref>" |
| CLOSED (unmerged) | any | RETRIAGE_PRS, **but** first re-run Vectors C/D/E to look for a replacement PR; emit RETRIAGE_PRS only if no replacement found |

The CLOSED→RETRIAGE_PRS branch is the failure case that produced wrong
verdicts in past reports — a closed PR is rarely the end of the story
when the issue itself is still open. The replacement-PR re-search is
**mandatory** for this branch, not optional.

The helper script
[`run_live_pr_state_recheck.py`](./run_live_pr_state_recheck.py)
implements this rule and is invoked by the Phase 4b agent during
Step 2.5 and by the Phase 5 reconciliation step.

### DERIVATION RULE: action_TBD from pr_analysis (mandatory)

After Step 2.5 the agent has, for each VERIFIED PR, a fresh
`live_state ∈ {MERGED, OPEN, CLOSED}`. The verb to emit in
`action_TBD` is derived deterministically per the precedence
**MERGED > OPEN > CLOSED-unmerged** of the highest-priority VERIFIED PR:

| Highest-priority live_state | action_Type      | Verb                                                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| MERGED                      | VERIFY_AND_CLOSE | `"Verify fix from merged PR <ref> and close"`                 |
| OPEN                        | LAND_PR          | `"Land PR <ref>"` + any Step-3 gate-specific verbs             |
| CLOSED unmerged (no replacement) | RETRIAGE_PRS | `"PR <ref> closed unmerged; reassess fix path"`               |

If all VERIFIED PRs are CLOSED-unmerged, the agent **must** re-run
Vectors C/D/E to look for a replacement; if found, recurse the rule on
the replacement's live_state. If still no replacement, emit
RETRIAGE_PRS.

If `pr_candidates` contains zero VERIFIED entries on an OPEN issue,
apply the **WAIT_FOR_PR fallback** before defaulting to NEED_ACTION:

| Predicate (all must hold)                                                                                  | action_Type   | Verb            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Zero VERIFIED {fixes,supersedes} PRs AND OPEN issue has a substantive comment from a user with `authorAssociation in {OWNER, COLLABORATOR, MEMBER}` (Assignee preferred) that acknowledges the bug as actionable AND describes a concrete fix path / commit / plan to file a PR | WAIT_FOR_PR   | `"Wait for PR"` |

When WAIT_FOR_PR fires, `owner_transferred` = the comment author from
the matched comment (Assignee if they authored a qualifying comment;
otherwise the qualifying commenter). Reporter is still never used. A
bare "I'll look into it" without a fix path / commit / submission plan
does **not** satisfy the predicate — fall through to NEED_ACTION.

If neither the VERIFIED-PR ladder nor WAIT_FOR_PR matches, emit
`"No action — investigate further"` (NEED_ACTION); never leave
`action_TBD` blank when `validation_status == "OK"`.

## Part 2: AR from Issue Comments

### Step 1: Fetch Issue Comments

```python
# Get all comments for the issue
gh issue view {issue_number} --repo intel/torch-xpu-ops --json comments
```

Comment structure:
```json
{
  "comments": [
    {

     prompt=f"""
DEEP ANALYSIS: Issue #{{issue_number}} Comments for AR Extraction

CONTEXT:
Analyze issue #{{issue_number}} comment history to identify unresolved requests.

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

1. COMMENT CLASSIFICATION
   Classify each comment by type and blocking level:

   a) MAINTAINER/CORE REVIEWER COMMENTS
      - High priority requests
      - Blocking actions required
      - Explicit requirements
   
   b) CONTIBUTOR/MEMBER COMMENTS  
      - Technical questions
      - Suggestions requiring consideration
      - Non-blocking
   
   c) BOT/AUTOMATED COMMENTS
      - CI results (informational)
      - Labels added/removed
      - Non-actionable by author

2. ACTION ITEM EXTRACTION
   
   For each actionable comment, identify:
   - Requester (author)
   - Request type (clarification, code change, test addition)
   - Priority (P0-P3)
   - Specific ask content
   - Deadline if mentioned

3. UNRESOLVED REQUEST TRACKING
   Track conversation threads to identify:
   - Open threads awaiting response
   - Follow-up requests without resolution
   - Stale requests (no author response)
   - Confirmed/acknowledged items

4. RESPONSE PATTERN DETECTION
   
   Analyze author response patterns:
   - Questions addressed
   - Requests accepted
   - Requests declined
   - Action items completed

SOURCE CODE LOCATIONS:
- ${PYTORCH_REPO_ROOT}/aten/src/ATen/native/
- ${PYTORCH_REPO_ROOT}/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/src/ATen/native/

ACTION:
For each unresolved request, provide:
- Owner (who requested)
- Content (what is needed)
- Priority (P0-P3)
- Blocking status

DO NOT USE simple pattern matching.
USE deep contextual investigation of comment intent.

## Part 3: Not-Target Check

### Purpose
Some issues are filed against features/test cases that the XPU team has explicitly decided NOT to support (won't-fix / out-of-scope / not a target feature). When an authoritative owner communicates such a decision in an issue comment, the triage action is to **label the issue `not_target`** (and close it if the decision covers every test case in the issue).

This check runs **before** the PR-based AR extraction (Part 1) and comment-based AR extraction (Part 2): if the issue is determined to be entirely not-target, downstream AR extraction is short-circuited.

### Detection Philosophy — READ THIS FIRST

**Not-target detection is a reasoning task, not a matching task.** Do NOT use regex, substring search, or a fixed phrase list to classify comments. Whether a comment expresses a binding not-target decision depends on:

- **Who said it** (authority of the commenter),
- **What they mean** (deny-the-feature vs. defer-the-fix vs. workaround-via-skip-list),
- **What scope it covers** (all cases in the issue, a specific subset, or just one case).

All three judgements require full-thread context. Accordingly, this check is implemented as a **single explore-agent invocation** that reads the entire issue (body + every comment, with `authorAssociation`) and returns a structured verdict. The local Python wrapper only gathers inputs and parses the agent's JSON output — it performs no classification itself.

### Step 1: Identify Authoritative Owners

Gather the set of logins whose comments can bind a not-target decision. This is the **only** mechanical step; the explore agent does everything else.

| Role | How to obtain |
|---|---|
| Issue assignees | `gh issue view <id> --repo intel/torch-xpu-ops --json assignees --jq '.assignees[].login'` |
| Accounts whose comments carry `authorAssociation = OWNER` | from comment metadata (returned by the fetch in Step 2) |
| Accounts whose comments carry `authorAssociation = COLLABORATOR` **and** appear in the triage-owner allowlist | allowlist is repo-specific; pass it into the agent |

Comments from `CONTRIBUTOR` / `MEMBER` / `NONE` authors are **never** binding not-target decisions; if they contain request-like content, they are handled by Part 2 (comment AR) instead.

### Step 2: Fetch Full Issue + Comment Thread

```bash
gh issue view {issue_number} --repo intel/torch-xpu-ops \
  --json number,title,body,assignees,comments \
  --jq '{number, title, body,
         assignees: [.assignees[].login],
         comments: [.comments[] | {author: .author.login,
                                   assoc: .authorAssociation,
                                   created: .createdAt,
                                   url: .url,
                                   body: .body}]}'
```

Pass the full result to the explore agent verbatim. Do **not** pre-filter comments by substring; the agent must see the entire thread to reason about scope, superseding statements, and reversals.

### Step 3: Delegate Classification to the Explore Agent (primary mechanism)

```python
task(description="not_target_check",
     subagent_type="explore",
     prompt=f"""
NOT-TARGET CHECK — Issue #{{issue_number}} in {{repo}}

You are classifying whether this issue has been declared not-target
(won't-fix / out-of-scope / not a supported feature on XPU) by an
authoritative owner. This is a *reasoning* task. Do not rely on keyword
matching; read every comment in context and judge intent.

INPUTS
- Issue title, body, assignees, and full comment thread (with
  authorAssociation, author login, timestamp, and URL per comment):
{{issue_json}}
- Authoritative owner set (only these authors can issue binding
  not-target decisions):
    - issue assignees
    - comment authors with authorAssociation in {{OWNER, COLLABORATOR (if
      in allowlist)}}
  Allowlist: {{owner_allowlist}}

PROCEDURE
1. Enumerate the test cases / sub-features the issue is about. Sources:
   issue title, issue body (tables, bullet lists, code blocks listing
   failing tests), and any comments from the reporter that add cases.
   Output the enumerated list as `all_cases`.
   - If the issue is a single-bug report with one test name, `all_cases`
     has one entry.
   - If cases are grouped (e.g., "all complex128 reductions"), preserve
     that grouping semantically — do not expand it into a fabricated
     list.

2. For every comment authored by a member of the authoritative owner
   set, decide: does this comment express a binding decision that the
   feature / test / sub-feature will not be supported on XPU?

   A binding not-target decision means the author is denying the
   feature itself on XPU (permanently, as a scope decision). Judge by
   meaning, not phrasing. Examples of shapes this can take — use them
   as illustrations, NOT as a match list:
     • "This op / dtype / path is not a target for XPU."
     • "We will not support this on XPU."
     • "Out of scope for XPU."
     • "Deprecated upstream; we are not picking it up on XPU."

   The following are explicitly NOT not-target — classify them as
   deferral / workaround / suggestion instead:
     • "Skip it in the skip list" (workaround; issue still open for
       eventual fix).
     • "Won't fix for this release / 2.x / until Triton supports it"
       (priority / deferral, feature is still in scope long-term).
     • "Skip for now" / "disable temporarily" (workaround).
     • A non-owner echoing a won't-fix sentiment.
     • An owner asking a question or speculating ("might not be
       targetable?") — only firm statements count.

3. For each binding not-target comment, determine which case(s) from
   `all_cases` it covers. Three shapes:
     • EXPLICIT: comment names the case(s).
     • BLANKET: comment refers to a whole class that subsumes listed
       cases (e.g., "complex128 reductions are not target" covers every
       complex128 reduction in `all_cases`).
     • SCOPE-LIMITED: comment covers only a subset (e.g., only Windows).
   Record the mapping per comment.

4. Compute:
     • covered_cases = union of cases covered across all binding
       not-target comments.
     • remaining_cases = all_cases − covered_cases.
     • If `covered_cases` is empty → no not-target decision exists.
     • If `remaining_cases` is empty → all cases are not-target (close).
     • Otherwise → partial not-target (label, do not close).

5. Pick `owner_transferred`: the login of the EARLIEST comment (by
   createdAt) that issued a binding not-target decision.

OUTPUT — return exactly this JSON, no prose:
{{
  "action_TBD": "label not_target"
                | "label not_target and close"
                | null,
  "owner_transferred": "<login>" | null,
  "all_cases": [ "<case>", ... ],
  "covered_cases": [ "<case>", ... ],
  "remaining_cases": [ "<case>", ... ],
  "evidence": [
    {{
      "comment_url": "...",
      "author": "<login>",
      "author_assoc": "OWNER|COLLABORATOR|ASSIGNEE",
      "created": "<iso8601>",
      "quoted_phrase": "<short excerpt for the triager's eyes, not a
                        matcher input>",
      "scope_shape": "EXPLICIT" | "BLANKET" | "SCOPE-LIMITED",
      "cases_covered": [ "<case>", ... ],
      "reasoning": "<1-3 sentences explaining why this is binding
                    not-target rather than deferral/workaround>"
    }}
  ]
}}

If no binding not-target decision exists, return `action_TBD: null`
with empty `covered_cases` / `evidence` / `remaining_cases`, and
`all_cases` still populated.
""")
```

### Step 4: Interpret the Agent's Verdict

The wrapper does three things only: map the agent's JSON onto `action_TBD`, pick the short-circuit branch, and attach evidence. No further classification is performed locally.

| Agent verdict | `action_TBD` | Downstream behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `action_TBD: null` | *(skip Part 3 output; proceed to Part 1 / Part 2 normally)* | — |
| `action_TBD: "label not_target"` (partial) | `label not_target` | Run Part 1 and Part 2 restricted to `remaining_cases`. Tag AR items for covered cases as `superseded-by-not-target`. |
| `action_TBD: "label not_target and close"` (all covered) | `label not_target and close` | **Skip** Part 1 and Part 2. Emit a single combined-AR entry recording the decision. |

### Step 5: Output Template

```markdown
## Not-Target Check

### Enumerated Cases
1. `test_case_1`
2. `test_case_2`
3. ...

### Owner Determination
- Assignees: @{assignee_list}
- Owner allowlist: [...]

### Not-Target Evidence
| Comment Date | Author (assoc) | Scope | Quoted Phrase | Cases Covered | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {date} | @{author} ({OWNER}) | BLANKET | "...not a target for XPU..." | [case_1, case_2] | Firm feature-denial, not a deferral |

### Decision
- `remaining_cases`: [case_3]        ← non-empty → partial
- `action_TBD`: **label not_target**
- `owner_transferred`: @{earliest_owner}

*(or, if remaining_cases is empty:)*
- `action_TBD`: **label not_target and close**
- `owner_transferred`: @{earliest_owner}
```

### Integration with AR Extraction

When `action_TBD` is set:
- Include it at the top of the combined AR output so triagers see the short-circuit decision immediately.
- If `... and close`, the combined AR list collapses to a single entry: `{source: "not_target_check", owner: <owner_transferred>, content: "Label not_target and close", priority: "P3", blocking: false}`.
- If just `label not_target`, add the entry AND continue with Part 1/Part 2 for `remaining_cases`.

## Deep Analysis Guidelines

### Conflict Resolution for Multiple PRs

When multiple PRs address the same issue:
1. Identify primary vs supporting PRs
2. Use check_pr_status analysis for each
3. Consolidate action items by priority
4. Flag conflicting requirements

### Priority Escalation Rules

| Condition | Escalation |
|-----------|------------|
| PR CI Failing + Comment blocking | P0 |
| PR Waiting + Comment request | P1 |
| Multiple unresolved requests | +1 level |
| Stale issues (>30 days pending) | +1 level |

### Owner Assignment Logic

```python
def assign_owner(ar_item: dict) -> str:
    """
    Determine primary owner for AR item.
    Priority: PR Author > Comment Author > Maintainer > Team
    """
    if ar_item["source"] == "pr" and ar_item.get("pr_author"):
        return f"@{ar_item['pr_author']} (PR author)"
    elif ar_item["source"] == "comment":
        return f"@{ar_item['commenter']} (requester)"
    elif ar_item.get("blocking"):
        return "Maintainer"
    else:
        return "Team"
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Issue with Merged PR

```python
# Get AR from issue 2442
result = get_AR_from_issue(2442, "intel/torch-xpu-ops")

# Output:
# - PR #3404 is MERGED
# - Issue verification: PASSED
# - No additional AR from comments
# - Combined AR: Issue FIXED
```

### Example 2: Issue with Open PR

```python
# Get AR from issue 3290
result = get_AR_from_issue(3290, "intel/torch-xpu-ops")

# Output:
# - No PR found
# - AR from comments: dtype mismatch investigation
# - Owner: Team
# - Combined AR: Investigate precision issue
```

### Example 3: Issue with Multiple PRs

```python
# Get AR from complex issue
result = get_AR_from_issue(XXXX, "intel/torch-xpu-ops")

# Output:
# - PR #A1 (MERGED) - partial fix
# - PR #A2 (OPEN) - additional changes needed
# - AR locations identified
# - Combined AR consolidated
```

## Bug Fix Applied

### Issue Fixed
Used the skill to extract AR from issue #2442 and incorrectly identified PR relationship.

### Root Cause
Used unreliable `select(.body | test("2442"))` pattern matching which returned wrong PR numbers from memory/cache.

### Fix Applied
1. Added **Step 2: CRITICAL Verification of PR Data** - must verify ANY discovered PR
2. Added `verify_pr_linkage()` function to validate PR-issue connection
3. Updated workflow to require verification before proceeding
4. Added validation status tracking in output

## Scripts (in this folder)

Helper scripts co-located with this skill. All use `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[7]` to locate the repo root, so they are safe to run from any CWD.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) | Canonical Phase 4b explore-agent prompt. Copied into `agent_space/phase4b/` at runtime by wave-builder scripts. Encodes the 6-vector PR discovery, 3-tier verification, Step 2.5 live re-check, 4-gate analysis, and the **DERIVATION RULE** that emits `action_TBD`/`action_reason`/`action_Type` from `pr_analysis`. |
| [`run_phase4b_merge.py`](./run_phase4b_merge.py) | Merge Phase 4b per-issue AR JSON results (from `agent_space/phase4b/wave*/`) into the Issues sheet of `result/torch_xpu_ops_issues.xlsx`. Populates `action_TBD`, `action_reason`, `owner_transferred`. |
| [`run_live_pr_state_recheck.py`](./run_live_pr_state_recheck.py) | Step 2.5 helper. `refresh_pr_state(pr)` re-queries `gh pr view` for the live `state` / `mergedAt` of a single PR. `find_replacement_prs(issue_number, repo, dead_prs)` re-runs Vectors C/D/E when the only verified candidates are CLOSED-unmerged. Used by Phase 4b agents directly and by the Phase 5 reconciliation script. |

> **Note (v1.6 — 2026-04-29):** The previous helper `run_pass_backfill.py`
> was retired. Its rule (VERIFIED + MERGED → VERIFY_AND_CLOSE,
> VERIFIED + OPEN → LAND_PR, VERIFIED + CLOSED-unmerged → RETRIAGE_PRS)
> was inlined into the Phase 4b agent prompt as the **DERIVATION RULE**
> (see `agent_space/phase4b/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`). Agents now emit the
> correct `action_TBD` verb during deep analysis, eliminating the need
> for a post-pass backfill pass. *(Historically this was called TRACK_PR
> and emitted "Track PR <ref> to merge"; v4.12 of AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
> collapsed both into `LAND_PR` / `"Land PR <ref>"`.)*

Typical run:
```bash
python3 opencode/issue_triage/.opencode/skills/bug_scrub/analyze_issue/get_AR_from_issue/run_phase4b_merge.py
```
