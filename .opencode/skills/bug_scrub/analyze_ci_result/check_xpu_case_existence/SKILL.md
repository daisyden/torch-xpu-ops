# Check XPU Test Case Existence Skill

> **Base constraints**: This subskill is governed by [`../../base-constraints.md`](../../base-constraints.md) (C1 logs->agent_space, C2 ask-on-blocker, C3 background status, C4 no over-skip). They apply even when not restated here.

## Purpose
Deep analysis of PyTorch XPU test case existence by tracing through code execution, comparing pytorch/test vs torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu, checking the daisyden/pytorch release/2.12 branch for distributed tests only, and examining parametrization infrastructure. Uses mandatory explore-agent assisted investigation and direct source/collection evidence, not scripts, filename patterns, or regex-only matching.

## Preconditions

### Environment
1. conda environment `pytorch_opencode_env` must be available:
   ```bash
   source "${CONDA_ACTIVATE:-$HOME/miniforge3/bin/activate}" "${PYTORCH_ENV:-pytorch_opencode_env}"
   ```

2. Required directory structure:
   - Main pytorch repo: `$PYTORCH_SRC`
   - XPU tests location: `$PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/`
   - Base tests location: `$PYTORCH_SRC/test/`
    - Distributed release-branch reference: https://github.com/daisyden/pytorch/tree/release/2.12

3. torch-xpu-ops is stored as third_party submodule at `third_party/torch-xpu-ops`

4. Source checkout selection:
   - Use the user-provided source path when given.
   - Otherwise set `PYTORCH_SRC=${PYTORCH_SRC:-$HOME/upstream/pytorch}`.
   - Do not hard-code private checkout paths in reusable commands.

### Required Tools
1. `task(subagent_type="explore")` - Mandatory per-case deep code exploration across PyTorch and torch-xpu-ops before final classification
2. `read` - Read files and directories with line numbers
3. `bash` - Execute shell commands for:
   - directory listing (`ls -la`)
   - pytest collection (`python3 -m pytest --collect-only`)
   - conda activation
   - find operations
4. `grep` - Search file contents with patterns
5. `glob` - File pattern matching

### Exploration Contract

For each Phase 2.4 **issue** that is not skipped by incremental mode, pick a single
representative Test Cases row (the first row of that issue with blank
`xpu_case_existence`) and run an `explore` sub-agent for that row. The explore
request must ask for the concrete base test definition, XPU wrapper/direct test
mechanism, parametrization path, skip-list/decorator evidence, and pytest
collection evidence when collection is feasible. Direct grep/find results may seed
the prompt, but they are not sufficient for final classification by themselves.

After classification, **propagate** the resulting `xpu_case_existence` value and
`case_existence_comments` to every other Test Cases row of the same issue whose
`xpu_case_existence` is still blank. Rationale: a single issue's TC rows share
the same test file and infrastructure, so one well-investigated classification
applies to the whole issue. Rows that already carry a non-blank value are never
overwritten.

Incremental skip granularity is per-cell: if `xpu_case_existence` is non-blank for
a given row, that row is skipped regardless of issue-level state.

Do not classify from a script, filename match, regex hit, or missing wrapper alone.
Final `True` / `False` must be backed by source lines read directly plus either
pytest `--collect-only` output or a documented reason why collection cannot apply
(for example, distributed skip-dictionary routing or a removed upstream base test).

## Workflow

### Step 0: Launch Explore-Agent Investigation

Before local manual checks, invoke an explore agent for the **representative**
Test Cases row of the issue (the first blank-`xpu_case_existence` row):

```python
task(
    subagent_type="explore",
    load_skills=[],
    run_in_background=False,
    description="check xpu case",
    prompt="""
CONTEXT: Phase 2.4 check_xpu_case_existence for one Test Cases row.
Workbook fields: issue=<issue>, test_file=<test_file>, origin_file=<origin_file>,
test_class=<test_class>, test_case=<test_case>. PYTORCH_SRC=<path>.
GOAL: Determine whether the exact XPU test case exists/generated/skipped/absent.
DOWNSTREAM: Result will populate Test Cases.XPU Case Exist and case_existence_comments.
REQUEST: Inspect PyTorch base tests, torch-xpu-ops XPU wrappers/direct files,
XPUPatchForImport usage, parametrization/OpInfo dtype filters, distributed skip
routing when applicable, and pytest --collect-only evidence when feasible. Return
source-file evidence and a proposed True/False with DetailReason. Do not rely on
filename or regex-only matching.
""",
)
```

Use the explore result as an input, then verify key claims by reading the cited
source files or running the relevant commands yourself before writing the workbook.

### Step 1: Locate Test Files By Deep Inspection

**Important**: XPU tests can live in MULTIPLE locations. Check ALL before declaring a test missing:

| Location | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `pytorch/test/` | Upstream pytorch tests (CUDA/CPU) | `test/test_ops.py` |
| `pytorch/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/` | XPU test wrappers | `test_ops_xpu.py` |
| `pytorch/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/distributed/` | **XPU distributed-specific tests** | `test_c10d_xccl.py` |
| `pytorch/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/extended/` | Extended XPU tests | `test_ops_xpu.py` |
| `pytorch/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/nn/` | NN-specific XPU tests | `test_convolution_xpu.py` |
| `pytorch/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/functorch/` | functorch XPU tests | |
| `pytorch/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/quantization/` | Quantization XPU tests | |

For every case, inspect the local sources before final classification:

1. Local upstream base test in `pytorch/test/`.
2. Local XPU test files under `third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/**`.
3. For distributed tests only, active distributed skip dictionaries, the remote release/2.12
   local distributed skip list from `intel/torch-xpu-ops` branch `daisyden/distributed_2.12`,
   standalone distributed XPU files, and the daisyden release branch
   `https://github.com/daisyden/pytorch/tree/release/2.12`.

Do not use `release/2.12` for non-distributed test classification. Non-distributed cases should
be classified from the local `pytorch/test/` and `third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/**` sources.

Do not stop after a filename or grep hit. Read the class/function body, decorators,
parametrization, wrapper/direct XPU file, and skip-list entry that determines whether the exact
XPU case is generated, skipped, or absent.


### Base-Function-First Rule

Before checking whether an XPU case exists, first identify the **base function** in the upstream
PyTorch test file. The base function is the function actually defined in source that most closely
generates the workbook case after decorators, device suffixes, dtype suffixes, OpInfo names, and
other parameter suffixes are applied.

Decision order:
1. Check `$PYTORCH_SRC/<testfile_cuda>` for the base function.
2. If the base function is absent, classify the workbook row as `Community Change`; the test was
   removed, renamed, moved, or refactored in the compared source.
3. If the base function exists, derive the expected XPU case by replacing `_cuda` with `_xpu` in
   `name_cuda`, then verify XPU generation through source, wrappers, parametrization, and collection.
4. A refactor from old generated names into one device-parameterized base function is also a
   community change for the old workbook case name. Example: old MinifierTests
   `test_after_dynamo_cpu_*` / `test_after_dynamo_cuda_*` rows replaced by
   `test_after_dynamo_*(self, device)`.
5. For Non-Inductor rows, inspect `$PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/**` including
   subfolders before deciding the XPU case is absent.

#### 1.1 Check torch-xpu-ops main location
```bash
ls -la $PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/
```
Look for the xpu test file matching the base test name pattern `<base_test>_xpu.py`

#### 1.2 Check base test in pytorch/test
```bash
ls -la $PYTORCH_SRC/test/<base_test>.py
```
Verify base test class exists in pytorch/test

#### 1.3 **Check torch-xpu-ops distributed subfolder and run_distributed.py (CRITICAL)**

XPU distributed tests run via active skip dictionaries and standalone XPU-native files. You MUST
check all mechanisms that exist in the checkout:

---

**Mechanism A — `run_distributed.py` + distributed skip dictionaries (upstream files run directly)**

`third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/run_distributed.py` imports the active distributed skip dict(s)
and calls `launch_test` on each path directly. No `*_xpu.py` wrapper file is created. Read
`run_distributed.py` first; do not assume which dictionary is active.

Known dictionary files to check:
- `intel/torch-xpu-ops` branch `daisyden/distributed_2.12`, file
  `test/xpu/skip_list_dist_local.py` for release/2.12 distributed classification. The file may
  be described as `skip_list_local_dist.py`, but the verified branch filename is
  `skip_list_dist_local.py`.
- `third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/skip_list_dist.py`
- `third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/skip_list_dict_local.py` if present in the checkout

```bash
# Step 1: Which dictionary does run_distributed.py import?
grep -n "skip_list_dist\|skip_list_dict_local\|skip_dict" \
  $PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/run_distributed.py

# Step 2: Is the upstream test file registered in every active distributed dictionary?
grep -n "<test_filename>" \
  $PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/skip_list_dist.py

# Step 3: If present, inspect local dictionary overrides too
test -f $PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/skip_list_dict_local.py && \
  grep -n "<test_filename>" \
    $PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/skip_list_dict_local.py
```

`skip_dict` / local skip-dict structure:
```python
skip_dict = {
    "../../../../test/distributed/<path>/test_foo.py": None,         # all tests run
    "../../../../test/distributed/<path>/test_bar.py": (             # specific tests skipped
        "test_skipped_method_xpu",
    ),
}
```

- Key present, value `None` → all tests in the file run on XPU
- Key present, value is a tuple/list → tests in the tuple/list are skipped; all others run
- Key absent from all active dictionaries → the file is NOT run on XPU through `run_distributed.py`

```bash
# Step 4: Read active dictionaries in full to see registered files and skipped cases
cat $PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/skip_list_dist.py
test -f $PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/skip_list_dict_local.py && \
  cat $PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/skip_list_dict_local.py
```

---

**Mechanism B — standalone XPU-native files in `distributed/` subfolder**

Some tests exist ONLY in torch-xpu-ops and have NO pytorch/test equivalent.

```bash
ls -la $PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/distributed/
```

**Known XPU-only distributed tests (no pytorch/test equivalent):**
- `test_c10d_xccl.py` - XCCL collective tests (XPU-specific, mirrors `test_c10d_nccl.py`)
- `test_c10d_ops_xccl.py` - XCCL ops tests (XPU-specific, mirrors `test_c10d_ops_nccl.py`)

These files also appear as entries in `skip_list_dist.py` under the `"distributed/test_c10d_xccl.py"` key (relative path, not `../../../../test/...`).

These files do NOT use `XPUPatchForImport` — they are standalone XPU-native tests.

---

**Decision for distributed tests:**

1. Read `run_distributed.py` to identify active distributed dictionary imports.
2. Check the remote release/2.12 local distributed skip list first, then `skip_list_dist.py` and
   `skip_list_dict_local.py` if present for the upstream file path.
3. If present with `None`, the file runs; then verify the exact test exists in the local source
   or in daisyden/pytorch release/2.12.
4. If present with tuple/list, compare the exact generated XPU test name against skipped cases.
5. Check `distributed/` subfolder for XPU-native standalone files.
6. If absent from all active dictionaries and no standalone XPU-native file exists:
   `xpu_case_existence = False`, DetailReason should be specific, e.g.
   `Distributed file missing from skip_list_dist.py` or
   `Distributed file missing from skip_list_dict_local.py`. Do not use generic `No XPU wrapper`.
   Explanation should state which dictionary files were read and what sibling files are enabled.

#### 1.3b Common (non-distributed) skip harness - `run_test_with_skip.py` + `skip_list_common.py` (CRITICAL)

Non-distributed XPU tests run through a SEPARATE harness from the distributed one above, but it
uses the IDENTICAL `None`/tuple skip-dict semantics. Apply the same reasoning here.

- Runner: `third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/run_test_with_skip.py`
  (`from skip_list_common import skip_dict`, `from xpu_test_utils import launch_test`).
- Main skip dict: `third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/skip_list_common.py` (`skip_dict`, keyed by
  `<test>_xpu.py`).
- Extended-suite skip dict: `third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/extended/skip_list_common.py`
  (`skip_dict`, used by the `extended/` runner).

`launch_test(test_case, skip_list=None, ...)` in `xpu_test_utils.py` builds the pytest filter as:

```python
if skip_list is not None and len(skip_list) > 0:
    skip_options = ' -k "not ' + skip_list[0]
    for skip_case in skip_list[1:]:
        skip_options += ' and not ' + skip_case
    ...
# else: no -k filter is added -> every collected case runs
```

Therefore, for the file that generates the workbook case:

- Key present, value `None` (or empty) -> NO `-k` filter -> all cases run -> `xpu_case_existence = True`.
- Key present, value tuple/list -> `-k "not A and not B ..."`; match the exact generated `_xpu`
  case name against the patterns as pytest `-k` substrings:
  - name MATCHES a skip pattern -> `xpu_case_existence = True-but-SKIPPED`
    (the variant IS generated and collected, just filtered out at runtime).
  - name does NOT match any pattern -> `xpu_case_existence = True`.
- File key ABSENT from the active `skip_dict` -> the file is not launched via this harness; confirm
  no wrapper/other runner generates it (e.g. `--collect-only`) before concluding `False`.

Do NOT read a `None` value as "the whole file is skipped" - `None` means the OPPOSITE (run all).

#### 1.4 Check other torch-xpu-ops subfolders

For tests that might be in extended/nn/functorch/quantization subfolders:
```bash
find $PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/ -name "<test_pattern>*.py"
```

#### 1.5 **Check daisyden release branch for distributed tests only (CRITICAL)**

For distributed tests only, local pytorch checkout may be on a different branch than what the issue
was reported against. Test cases could be **renamed, removed, or relocated** between pytorch versions due to:
- Test refactoring (e.g., class merging, method renaming)
- Parametrization changes (e.g., changing `@parametrize` args)
- Test being moved to a new file
- Test being deleted as obsolete

**Reference release branches:**
- Release 2.12: https://github.com/daisyden/pytorch/tree/release/2.12
- Release 2.11: https://github.com/daisyden/pytorch/tree/release/2.11
- Main: https://github.com/daisyden/pytorch/tree/main

**Check against pytorch release branch via GitHub:**
```bash
# Option A: Use gh CLI to check file contents at specific branch
gh api repos/daisyden/pytorch/contents/test/<base_test>.py?ref=release/2.12 \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d | grep -n "<test_class_or_method>"

# Option B: Use raw GitHub URL via curl
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daisyden/pytorch/release/2.12/test/<base_test>.py | \
  grep -n "<test_class_or_method>"

# Option C: Use git to check a specific ref if submodule/remote is configured
cd "$PYTORCH_SRC" && git show release/2.12:test/<base_test>.py 2>/dev/null | grep -n "<pattern>"
```

**Decision logic with release branch check (distributed tests only):**
```
1. Test NOT in local pytorch/test:
   → Check release/2.12 branch on GitHub
   → If found in release/2.12 → Test was REMOVED/renamed in current main
     Reason: "Test removed after release/2.12"
   → If also not in release/2.12 → Test never existed here
     Reason: "Test not in pytorch release/2.12 or main"

2. Test IS in local pytorch/test:
   → Also verify it's in release/2.12 (for issue consistency)
   → If missing in release/2.12 → Test is newer than release
     Reason: "Test added after release/2.12"
```

**When to invoke release branch check:**
- Distributed test class/method "removed/renamed" reason
- Distributed issue reported on older pytorch version but test now missing locally
- Distributed discrepancy between local source and release branch

Do not invoke release/2.12 checks for non-distributed tests.

#### 1.6 Read XPU wrapper/direct file structure
File: `third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/<test>_xpu.py`

Typical structure:
```python
with XPUPatchForImport(False):
    from <base_module> import <BaseTestClass>

instantiate_device_type_tests(
    <BaseTestClass>, globals(), only_for="xpu", allow_xpu=True
)
```

This is only one pattern. Many XPU files are direct/standalone copies or hand-written XPU tests
that do not use `XPUPatchForImport`. For those files, inspect the XPU file itself:
- Does it define the target class/function directly?
- Does it assign/replace methods on an imported class before instantiation?
- Does it call `instantiate_device_type_tests`, `instantiate_parametrized_tests`, or both?
- Does the generated XPU test name exist after parametrization?
- Does the file use `only_for="xpu"`, `allow_xpu=True`, or a broader device list including XPU?

### Step 2: Understand XPUPatchForImport Behavior

#### 2.1 Read xpu_test_utils.py XPUPatchForImport class
File: `$PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/xpu_test_utils.py` starting at line 972

Critical finding: `XPUPatchForImport(False)` OVERRIDES decorators during import!

Key transformations in `__enter__` (lines 1131-1168):
```python
# CRITICAL: Decorator overrides during import!
common_device_type.onlyCUDA = common_device_type.onlyXPU  # @onlyCUDA -> @onlyXPU
common_device_type.skipXPU = _skipXPU  # @skipXPU -> NOP (_skipXPU returns obj)
common_device_type.onlyNativeDeviceTypes = common_device_type.onlyXPU
```

#### 2.2 XPUPatchForImport Override Effects
| Original Decorator | After PATCH | Impact on XPU |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| `@skipXPU` | `_skipXPU` (NOP) | NOT skipped on XPU! |
| `@onlyCUDA` | `@onlyXPU` | CAN RUN on XPU! |
| `@onlyNativeDeviceTypes` | `@onlyXPU` | XPU is allowed |
| `instantiate_parametrized_tests` | `DO_NOTHING` if `patch_test_case=True` | Parametrized tests disabled |

#### 2.3 Verify PATCH Usage
Check if XPU wrapper uses PATCH:
```bash
grep -l "XPUPatchForImport" third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/*.py
```

Typical XPU test wrapper structure:
```python
with XPUPatchForImport(False):  # False = DON'T disable instantiation
    from test_ops import TestCommon

instantiate_device_type_tests(
    TestCommon, globals(), only_for="xpu", allow_xpu=True
)
```

#### 2.4 Decision Matrix
```
IF XPU wrapper uses get_dtypesIf_mock/dtypesIfCUDA mocking -> test is generated
IF XPU file uses XPUPatchForImport(False):
    THEN @skipXPU/@onlyCUDA are OVERRIDDEN during import → imported tests may run on XPU
ELSE IF XPU file uses XPUPatchForImport(True):
    THEN device/parametrized instantiation from the imported module may be disabled
ELSE:
    The XPU file is direct/standalone. Read its definitions and decorators literally;
    @onlyCUDA is not patched unless the file itself changes it.
```

#### 2.5 Critical Line Analysis (line 1143-1144)
```python
if self.patch_test_case:
    common_device_type.instantiate_device_type_tests = DO_NOTHING
    common_utils.instantiate_parametrized_tests = DO_NOTHING
```

Only if `patch_test_case=True` instantiation is disabled.

### Step 3: Trace Base Test Parametrization

#### 3.1 Find the decorated test function
```grep
pattern: <test_function_name_without_prefix>
path: $PYTORCH_SRC/test
```

Extract the test function and its decorator:
```python
@ops(<op_db_name>)
def <test_function_name>(self, device, dtype, op):
    # function body
```

#### 3.2 Analyze decorator and parameters
Key elements to identify:
- `@ops(<op_db>)` - op_db parametrization from common_methods_invocations
- `@dtypes(...)` - direct dtype parametrization
- `@dtypesIfXPU(...)` - XPU-specific dtype filters
- Function signature parameters: `(self, device, dtype, op)` for @ops

#### 3.3 Find instantiate_device_type_tests call
```grep
pattern: instantiate_device_type_tests.*<TestClassName>
path: $PYTORCH_SRC/test/<base_test>.py
```

Key parameter: `allow_xpu=True` must be present for XPU test generation

### Step 4: Locate OpInfo Definition

#### 4.1 OpInfo Database Locations

OpInfo definitions are spread across multiple locations:

| Location | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Main op_db | `torch/testing/_internal/common_methods_invocations.py` | Primary OpInfo definitions including `BinaryUfuncInfo`, `UnaryUfuncInfo` |
| OpInfo core | `torch/testing/_internal/opinfo/core.py` | `OpInfo` class definition |
| OpInfo definitions | `torch/testing/_internal/opinfo/definitions/` | Modularized OpInfo definitions |
| FFT ops | `torch/testing/_internal/opinfo/definitions/fft.py` | FFT-related operators |
| Linalg ops | `torch/testing/_internal/opinfo/definitions/linalg.py` | Linear algebra operators |
| Signal ops | `torch/testing/_internal/opinfo/definitions/signal.py` | Signal processing operators |
| Special ops | `torch/testing/_internal/opinfo/definitions/special.py` | Special mathematical functions |
| Masked ops | `torch/testing/_internal/opinfo/definitions/_masked.py` | Masked operations |
| Nested ops | `torch/testing/_internal/opinfo/definitions/nested.py` | Nested tensor operations |
| Sparse ops | `torch/testing/_internal/opinfo/definitions/sparse.py` | Sparse tensor operators |
| Custom ops | `torch/testing/_internal/custom_op_db.py` | Custom operator definitions |
| Hop ops | `torch/testing/_internal/hop_db.py` | Higher order operator patterns |

#### 4.2 OpInfo Groupings

Common op_db groupings defined at end of `common_methods_invocations.py`:
```python
ops_and_refs = op_db + python_ref_db
unary_ufuncs = [op for op in ops_and_refs if isinstance(op, UnaryUfuncInfo)]
binary_ufuncs = [op for op in ops_and_refs if isinstance(op, BinaryUfuncInfo)]
spectral_funcs = [op for op in ops_and_refs if isinstance(op, SpectralFuncInfo)]
sparse_unary_ufuncs = [op for op in op_db if isinstance(op, UnaryUfuncInfo) and op.supports_sparse]
reduction_ops = [op for op in ops_and_refs if isinstance(op, ReductionOpInfo)]
shape_funcs = [op for op in ops_and_refs if isinstance(op, ShapeFuncInfo)]
```

#### 4.3 Find OpInfo for the operator
```grep
pattern: BinaryUfuncInfo\('<op_name>'\)|OpInfo\('<op_name>'\)|UnaryUfuncInfo\('<op_name>'\)
path: $PYTORCH_SRC/torch/testing/_internal/
```

Note: The op_name extraction depends on context:
- Parameterized tests with `@ops(op_db)`: extracted from test function name
- Direct dtype tests: inferred from surrounding test context

#### 4.4 Extract dtype restrictions
From OpInfo definition, identify:
```python
dtypes=...                    # Base dtypes supported (applied if dtypesIfXPU not set)
dtypesIfXPU=...               # XPU-specific dtypes override
dtypesIfCUDA=...             # CUDA-specific for comparison
skips=...                     # Skip decorators with device_type='xpu'
```

#### 4.5 Understand dtype function expansion
File: `$PYTORCH_SRC/torch/testing/_internal/common_dtype.py`

Key dtype helpers:
```python
def floating_types_and(*dtypes):
    # Returns: {float32, float64} + provided dtypes
    return _floating_types + _validate_dtypes(*dtypes)

def floating_and_complex_types_and(*dtypes):
    # Returns: {float32, float64, cfloat, cdouble} + provided dtypes
    return _floating_and_complex_types + _validate_dtypes(*dtypes)

def all_types():
    # Returns: _floating_types + _integral_types
```

Used to expand macros like `floating_types_and(torch.bfloat16, torch.float16)`

### Step 5: Parse Test Name Pattern

#### 5.1 Understand generated test naming
Full test name format:
```
<test_function_name>_<op_name>_xpu_<dtype>
```

Examples:
- `test_contig_size1_large_dim_logaddexp_xpu_complex128`
- `test_contig_size1_large_dim_div_xpu_float32`

#### 5.2 Break down components
- `<test_function_name>`: The actual test method name in base test class
- `<op_name>`: Extracted from `@ops(op_db)` decorator where `op` parameter
- `_xpu_`: Device suffix indicating XPU
- `<dtype>`: The specific dtype being tested

### Step 6: Verify Test Generation with pytest

#### 6.1 Collect tests to verify parametrization
```bash
source "${CONDA_ACTIVATE:-$HOME/miniforge3/bin/activate}" "${PYTORCH_ENV:-pytorch_opencode_env}" && \
cd "$PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu" && \
python3 -m pytest <test_file>_xpu.py --collect-only 2>/dev/null | \
grep "<test_function_name>_<op_name>"
```

#### 6.2 Compare generated vs expected
List all collected variants to verify which dtypes are available

### Step 7: Determine Absence Reason

#### 7.1 Classify absence reason with specific DetailReason

**Reason 1: Specific XPU test enablement gap**
- Do not write only `No XPU wrapper` as DetailReason.
- State the concrete gap, such as:
  - `XPU test file missing in torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/<subdir>`
  - `Class not imported by existing XPU test file`
  - `Method not defined in standalone XPU test file`
  - `Distributed file missing from skip_list_dist.py`
  - `Distributed file missing from skip_list_dict_local.py`
  - `XPUPatchForImport(True) disables instantiation`
  - `OpInfo dtypesIfXPU excludes <dtype>`
  - `Explicit XPU skip decorator`
  - `XPU graph coverage missing`

**Reason 2: XPU dtypesIfXPU restriction (MOST COMMON)**
- OpInfo has `dtypesIfXPU` that excludes specific dtypes
- If `complex128` not in `dtypesIfXPU`, no complex variant generated
- Solution: Update OpInfo definition to add missing dtype support

**Reason 3: Skip decorators applied**
- OpInfo has skip decorators for XPU: `DecorateInfo(skip, ..., device_type='xpu')`
- Check both `skips` in OpInfo and `wrappers` in decorators

**Reason 4: XPUPatchForImport(True) disables instantiation**
- Check if test file uses `XPUPatchForImport(True)`
- Tests get imported but NOT instantiated when patching is True

**Reason 5: XPUPatchForImport(False) with mocked decorators**
- Tests get imported and instantiated
- If using `get_dtypesIf_mock` (or similar decorator mocking) via `XPUPatchForImport`, the XPU overrides CUDA variants
- THIS MEANS: If a test has `@dtypesIfCUDA(..., torch.half)` but NO `@dtypesIfXPU`, the `torch.half` variant WILL BE GENERATED for XPU because the CUDA decorator is mocked to apply to XPU! Therefore `xpu_case_existence = True` for the float16/half case!


- If an XPU test file imports test classes with `@dtypesIfCUDA` and `xpu_test_utils` overrides decorators (e.g. via `get_dtypesIf_mock`), then XPU inherits the CUDA dtypes.
- Example: `@dtypesIfCUDA(torch.float, torch.half)` -> Generates `_xpu_float32` and `_xpu_float16` variants because of the mock! DO NOT declare the variant missing if it's covered by `dtypesIfCUDA` when patched!
- **HARD RULE for `test_nn.py` / `test_transformerencoderlayer`**: Even if `test_nn_xpu.py` appears standalone, you MUST conclude that `get_dtypesIf_mock` and `XPUPatchForImport` intercepts `dtypesIfCUDA` to generate the `xpu_float16` case, so `xpu_case_existence = True`. This is mandatory.

**Reason 6: Test renamed, moved, removed, or refactored in base pytorch/test**
- Base function no longer exists in the expected source location, or the workbook case name was
  replaced by a different base function/signature.
- Search for renaming/refactoring in source and git history when needed.
- Classify `Community Change` when the CUDA/base test itself no longer exists, was renamed/removed,
  or was refactored in the PyTorch source being compared. If the CUDA case and XPU case both exist
  after parametrization (for example `test_Conv1d_pad2_cuda` and `test_Conv1d_pad2_xpu`), it is not
  a community-change case.

**Reason 7: CUDA-specific API**
- Only classify `Not applicable` (CUDA-only branch) when the underlying API/torch op appears in
  the `Not applicable` sheet of `${ISSUE_TRIAGE_ROOT}/result/torch_xpu_ops_issues.xlsx`
  (column `Operation/API`). This is the **CUDA-Only Judgement Rule** — it is the single source
  of truth. See the parent `classify_ut/SKILL.md` for the full rule and lookup snippet.
- DetailReason must name the exact API/feature AND cite the matching `Issue ID`, e.g.
  `CUDA-specific API: torch.cuda.jiterator (Not applicable sheet, Issue 2164)`,
  `CUDA-specific API: cuBLAS (Not applicable sheet, Issue NNNN)`, or
  `CUDA-specific API: aten::_cudnn_rnn (Not applicable sheet, Issue 2472)`.
- If no matching `Operation/API` entry exists, the behavior is NOT CUDA-only; re-route to
  `To be enabled`, `Failures (xpu broken)`, `Feature gap`, or `Community Change`.
- Do not classify CUDA graph/cudagraph rows as `Not applicable` solely due to CUDA naming;
  XPU graph support exists via `_XPUGraph` and `torch.accelerator.Graph`, so missing/failing
  coverage should generally be `To be enabled / XPU graph coverage missing` after code inspection.

#### 7.2 Cross-reference with CUDA support
Compare `dtypesIfCUDA` vs `dtypesIfXPU` to understand:
- If XPU lags behind CUDA in dtype support
- Identifies specific dtype gaps between platforms

## Constraints

### Directory Structure Constraint
torch-xpu-ops MUST be located at `third_party/torch-xpu-ops` - NOT at workspace root as a separate repo

### Distributed Test Location Constraint
Tests with `origin_file` path like `test/distributed/test_c10d_xccl.py` may be XPU-native and only exist at:
`third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/distributed/test_c10d_xccl.py` — NOT in `pytorch/test/distributed/`.
But many distributed tests run upstream `pytorch/test/distributed/**` files through
`run_distributed.py` and active skip dictionaries. Always inspect the current mechanism.

### Release Branch Verification Constraint
For distributed tests only, when tests are not found locally, MUST verify against the daisyden
release branch before declaring removed:
- Release 2.12 is the reference: https://github.com/daisyden/pytorch/tree/release/2.12
- Use `gh api` or raw.githubusercontent.com to check file contents at specific ref
- Distinguish between "removed after release/2.12" vs "never existed" reasons

For non-distributed tests, do not check release/2.12; classify from local `pytorch/test/` and
local `third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/**` source inspection.

### Conda Environment Constraint
All Python analysis MUST be performed within `pytorch_opencode_env` conda environment to access correct pytorch modules

### pytest Collection Constraint
- pytest `--collect-only` MUST be run from `third_party/torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu/` directory
- Output filtering requires matching correct test name patterns

### OpInfo dtype Constraint
The generated test name dtype is determined by `dtypesIfXPU` (if set) NOT the base `dtypes` field

### XPUPatchForImport Behavior Constraint
- Parameter `False`: Allows instantiation, tests WILL be generated
- Parameter `True`: Disables instantiation, tests WILL NOT be generated

## Output Format

> In the current layout these resolve to col 13 (`XPU Case Exist`), col 14

> **`XPU Case Exist` value vocabulary (CRITICAL).** The column accepts exactly three literal

> `skip_list_common.py`/`extended/skip_list_common.py`, a distributed tuple skip in
> `skip_list_dist.py`, or a `@skipIfXpu` runtime skip. Never invent other values (e.g.
> `Not applicable`): CUDA-only status is recorded as a prefix note in `case_existence_comments`,
> not as an `XPU Case Exist` value.

## Critical Decision Tree

```
START: Identify origin_file type
├─ origin_file is under test/distributed/ (any distributed test)
│  └─ STEP A: Read run_distributed.py to identify active dictionary imports
│     └─ STEP B: Read skip_list_dist.py and skip_list_dict_local.py if present
│        ├─ File path found in an active dict, value None
│        │  └─ Check local pytorch/test and daisyden release/2.12 for exact test method
│        │     ├─ Found → xpu_case_existence=True
│        │     └─ Not found → classify by removed/renamed evidence, not by skip-list alone
│        ├─ File path found in active dict, value tuple/list
│        │  ├─ test_method NOT in skipped list → xpu_case_existence=True
│        │  └─ test_method IN skipped list → xpu_case_existence=True-but-SKIPPED
│        │     DetailReason: "Skipped in <dict file>: <specific test>"
│        └─ File path NOT in any active dict
│           └─ STEP C: Check distributed/ subfolder for XPU-native standalone file
│              ├─ Standalone XPU file exists AND test class/method found → xpu_case_existence=True
│              └─ Not found anywhere → xpu_case_existence=False
│                 DetailReason: "Distributed file missing from <dict file>"
│                 Explanation: cite all dict files read and sibling files enabled
│
└─ Standard (non-distributed) test case → Continue below

CHECK: Locate XPU test file/function under all torch-xpu-ops/test/xpu subfolders
├─ No XPU file/function/class found
│  └─ Check local pytorch/test before concluding
│     DetailReason: "XPU test file missing" or "Class not imported by XPU test file"
└─ XPU file found → Continue

CHECK: Determine XPU file mechanism
├─ Uses XPUPatchForImport(False) → imported decorators may be patched; inspect imports and instantiation
├─ Uses XPUPatchForImport(True) → imported parametrized/device tests may not be generated
└─ Does NOT use XPUPatchForImport → direct/standalone file; read definitions literally

CHECK: Base test function/class exists in local pytorch/test?
├─ NO → xpu_case_existence=False
│  Reason: "Test class removed/renamed in local pytorch/test"
└─ YES → Continue

CHECK: If both CUDA and XPU variants exist after parametrization
├─ YES → NOT Community Changes; classify by XPU status/skip/failure/enablement gap
└─ NO → For non-distributed tests, classify from local source only; release/2.12 is distributed-only

CHECK: Common skip harness (skip_list_common.py / extended/skip_list_common.py skip_dict)
├─ File key present, value None → no -k filter → all cases run → xpu_case_existence=True
├─ File key present, value tuple/list → build -k "not <patterns>"; match generated _xpu name
│  ├─ name MATCHES a skip pattern → xpu_case_existence=True-but-SKIPPED
│  │  DetailReason: "Runtime -k skip in <skip_list file>: <matched pattern>"
│  └─ name does NOT match any pattern → xpu_case_existence=True
└─ File key ABSENT → not launched via run_test_with_skip.py; confirm via wrapper/--collect-only
   before concluding (do NOT auto-False), then continue to the OpInfo/decorator checks below

CHECK: CUDA graph / cudagraph case
├─ YES → XPU graph support exists; classify missing/failing coverage as To be enabled
│        DetailReason: "XPU graph coverage missing" or exact XPU graph failure
└─ NO → Continue

CHECK: @skipIfXPU decorator on class/method (BLOCKS at runtime, NOT overridden by PATCH)
├─ YES → xpu_case_existence=True
│  Note: @skipIfXpu is a RUNTIME skip, not a parametrization failure.
│  The test variant IS still generated by parametrization (exists as a test case),
│  it just gets skipped when executed on XPU.
│  Reason format: "Variant generated; @skipIfXpu at <file:line> skips at runtime"
└─ NO → Continue

CHECK: OpInfo dtypesIfXPU excludes given dtype
├─ YES → xpu_case_existence=False
│  DetailReason: "OpInfo dtypesIfXPU excludes <dtype>"
└─ NO → Continue

CHECK: Skip decorators for XPU in OpInfo skips list
├─ YES → xpu_case_existence=False
│  DetailReason: "OpInfo skip decorator applied: <specific decorator>"
└─ NO → xpu_case_existence=True
   Reason: "Test exists and runs on XPU"
```
